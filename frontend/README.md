# Ethereum Blockchain-Based ToDo List Web App

This project is a decentralized ToDo list application built on the Ethereum blockchain. The app allows users to create, view, and manage their tasks using blockchain technology. It is developed using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Ethers.js, Solidity, and Ganache for local Ethereum blockchain testing. MetaMask is used for handling Ethereum accounts and transactions.

## Features

- **Decentralized ToDo List**: Manage tasks on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Blockchain Technology**: All tasks are stored and managed using smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
- **Ethers.js**: Interact with the Ethereum blockchain using the Ethers.js library.
- **Solidity**: Smart contracts written in Solidity to manage the tasks on the blockchain.
- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering and a React-based frontend.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive and customizable styling.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Secure Ethereum account management and transaction handling.
- **Ganache**: Local Ethereum blockchain for testing and development.

## Tech Stack
